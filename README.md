National Map
============

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/NICTA/nationalmap.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/NICTA/nationalmap)

The [National Map](http://nationalmap.nicta.com.au) is a website for map-based access to Australian spatial data from government agencies. The current version of the National Map is a "beta" service and we will be making lots of changes while we experiment with how users want to use the site and the data services. Later in 2014, it will become a fully supported stable "production" site. The site is being made available in time for [govhack 2014](http://govhack.org/) to help developers access data through the National Map and also to build new value-add applications which extend its functionality.

The National Map is an initiative of the Australian Commonwealth Government's [Department of Communications](http://www.communications.gov.au/) and the software has been developed by [NICTA](http://www.nicta.com.au/) working closely with the Department of Communications, [Geoscience Australia](http://www.ga.gov.au/) and other government agencies. The current "beta" site is hosted by NICTA but the plan is that it will be hosted by Geoscience Australia when it reaches "production" stage. The data services you can access through the National Map are hosted by government agencies such as Geoscience Australia and the Bureau of Meteorology.

The National Map is designed to:
* Provide easy access to authoritative and other spatial data to government, business and public
* Facilitate the opening of data by federal, state and local government bodies
* Provide an open framework of geospatial data services that supports commercial and community innovation

It is still very much proof of concept application, with revisions and releases occuring daily while we refine it.
